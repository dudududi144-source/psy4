Task: PSY4 deep commercial audio rebuild — build real DSP foundation (Moog ladder filter + band-limited oscillators + bus architecture) to replace sterile BiquadFilter/PeriodicWave voices.

Work Log:
- Read PSY3 source at /tmp/psy3/tools/pro_dsp.py — extracted exact algorithms:
  - `moog()`: 4-stage tanh ladder with feedback (g = 1-exp(-2π·fc), fb = res*4*tanh(st[3]), u = tanh(x-fb), 4 integrators with tanh, out = st[3]/(1+res*0.5))
  - `bl_saw()`: additive synthesis with adaptive N = max(1, SR/(2*f)) harmonics
  - `worklet.js`: AudioWorklet with band-limited wavetable + per-voice one-pole LP + tanh output
- Audited PSY4 current state: `proAudioNodes.ts` had a "MoogFilterChain" that was just BiquadFilter+WaveShaper (NOT the real algorithm). Voices used PeriodicWave with fixed 48 harmonics (aliasing at high pitches).
- Created `public/worklets/psy4-dsp.js` — AudioWorklet module with 6 processors:
  - `moog-filter`: REAL 4-stage tanh ladder, sample-accurate, a-rate cutoff AudioParam, per-channel state, ported from PSY3 pro_dsp.py
  - `bl-saw`: band-limited sawtooth via polyBLEP (2nd-order polynomial correction at discontinuity) — no aliasing at any frequency
  - `bl-square`: band-limited square via dual polyBLEP
  - `saturation`: tanh waveshaper with LUT-optimized fastTanh, drive+mix AudioParams
  - `phaser`: 4-stage allpass chain with internal LFO + feedback
  - `bus-eq`: 3-band EQ (low shelf / mid peak / high shelf) using RBJ cookbook biquad coefficients in transposed direct form II
- Created `src/lib/studio/engine/workletDsp.ts` — TypeScript wrapper:
  - `ensureWorkletsLoaded(ctx)`: loads module once, cached promise, graceful fallback
  - Factory functions: `createMoogFilter`, `createBLSaw`, `createBLSquare`, `createSaturation`, `createPhaser`, `createBusEQ` — each returns typed AudioWorkletNode with AudioParam access
- Integrated into `psy4LiveEngine.ts`:
  - Added `workletsReady` flag + async loading in `init()`
  - Built `createVoiceFilter()` helper: returns real Moog worklet node if ready, else falls back to BiquadFilter approximation
  - Built `createVoiceOsc()` helper: returns BL saw/square worklet if ready, else falls back to OscillatorNode+PeriodicWave
  - Added `scheduleCleanup()` for worklet node lifecycle management (disconnect after note ends)
  - Built BUS ARCHITECTURE: 5 buses (drum/bass/music/atmos/fx), each with lowShelf EQ → highShelf EQ → compressor → tanh saturation → sum. Channel strips now route to buses via `busForChannel()` instead of flat channel→sum.
- Rebuilt 4 critical voices with real DSP:
  - **bass**: sub (sine f/2, bypasses filter) + body (BL saw → Moog ladder with cutoff envelope sweep high→low) — the tanh saturation in the Moog adds harmonic character BiquadFilter cannot
  - **lead**: N detuned BL saws (supersaw) → Moog filter with envelope + LFO cutoff modulation → stereo spread — polyBLEP eliminates the harsh aliasing of PeriodicWave
  - **acid**: BL square → high-resonance Moog (near self-oscillation) with envelope sweep → distortion — the real ladder feedback gives the squelchy "acid" character
  - **pad**: detuned BL saws → Moog filter → evolving detune LFO modulating frequency → stereo width + reverb send
- Verified end-to-end with Agent Browser:
  - `[PSY4] AudioWorklet DSP module loaded` confirmed in console
  - 0 runtime errors on fresh page load (fixed a stale toFixed UI bug with `?? 0` guard)
  - Audio playing at 53-72% level (natural dynamics visible)
  - Stable for 30+ seconds across progressive-psy and dark-psy worlds
  - World switching works (dark-psy exercises the rebuilt acid voice)
  - Action buttons work (Drop tested, level 71%, 0 errors)
- Lint passes cleanly (0 errors, 0 warnings)

Stage Summary:
- **Foundation rebuilt**: Real sample-accurate Moog ladder filter + band-limited polyBLEP oscillators now run in the Web Audio audio thread via AudioWorklet, replacing the sterile BiquadFilter + aliasing PeriodicWave that made PSY4 sound like a "prototype DSP demo".
- **Bus architecture live**: 5 production buses (drum/bass/music/atmos/fx) with per-bus EQ + compression + saturation give group-level mixing control.
- **4 critical voices rebuilt**: bass, lead, acid, pad all route through real Moog filter with envelope sweeps, BL oscillators (no aliasing), and proper saturation.
- **Graceful fallback**: If AudioWorklet fails to load (old browser), voices fall back to BiquadFilter+PeriodicWave so the engine never breaks.
- **Artifacts**: `public/worklets/psy4-dsp.js` (18KB, 6 processors), `src/lib/studio/engine/workletDsp.ts` (typed wrapper), `psy4LiveEngine.ts` (buses + 4 rebuilt voices).
- **Next steps (P1)**: phaser + shimmer FX on voices, modulation matrix (LFO/env/macro → filter cutoff/osc pitch/pan), FM texture, sample variation, per-hit variation. The DSP foundation is now in place to support these.
